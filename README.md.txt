# Elevator Parking Place Problem Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing elevator movement data to solve the "Parking Place Problem" for elevators. Using Python and Plotly, the project performs various data analysis tasks on elevator journeys, tracking movements between floors, detecting periods of inactivity, and identifying the most frequently used parking floors when elevators are idle. The analysis provides insights into elevator performance, movement patterns, and potential inefficiencies in parking locations. 

## Project Structure
- `code/`: Contains the main Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- `data/`: Raw elevator movement data (excluded from the repository using `.gitignore`).
- `graphs/`: Generated graphs and visualizations in HTML and PNG formats.
- `images/`: Additional images for visual explanations or README visuals.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Elevator-Parking-Place-Problem-Analysis.git
    ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the analysis scripts** in the `code/` folder.
4. **View the generated visualizations** in the `graphs/` folder.

## Visualizations
The project generates several visualizations, including:
- Heatmaps showing the frequency of elevator movements between floors.
- Bar charts illustrating the total number of returns to each floor.

## Requirements
The project uses Python with the following libraries:
- pandas
- plotly

Make sure to install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
